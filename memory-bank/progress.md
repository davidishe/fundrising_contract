## COMPLEXITY ASSESSMENT

### Current Assessment: Level 3-4 (Intermediate to Complex)

**Complexity Factors**:
- Multiple smart contract coordination
- Financial logic with refund mechanisms
- Administrative controls and security
- Scalable architecture with individual user contracts
- Custom jetton implementation on TON

**Mode Routing Decision**: VAN â†’ PLAN â†’ CREATIVE â†’ VAN QA â†’ BUILD

## KEY ACHIEVEMENTS

### Session 1: Foundation Establishment
- âœ… Complete Memory Bank initialization
- âœ… Requirements analysis and documentation
- âœ… Architecture pattern selection (Master-Child)
- âœ… Technology stack confirmation (Tact + TON)
- âœ… Scalability approach validated

### Core Decisions Made
1. **Architecture**: Master-Child Contract Pattern
   - Master Contract for global management
   - Individual User Contracts for scalability

2. **Technology Stack**: Tact + TON Blockchain
   - Type-safe smart contract development
   - Optimal gas efficiency
   - Native TON integration

3. **Scalability Strategy**: Individual user contracts
   - Prevents bottlenecks
   - Enables parallel processing
   - Isolates user data
