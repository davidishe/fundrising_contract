# Deployment Fixes Summary

## 🎯 Problem Solved: Script Hangs on Transaction Signing

### ✅ What Was Fixed

1. **Added Transaction Timeouts**
   - 60 seconds for wallet approval
   - 2 minutes for blockchain confirmation
   - Graceful timeout handling with helpful messages

2. **Improved Error Messages**
   - Clear instructions when timeout occurs
   - Wallet troubleshooting tips
   - Manual verification options

3. **Added Wallet Diagnostic Tool**
   - `walletDiagnostic.ts` script to test connection
   - Checks wallet availability, address, network
   - Provides troubleshooting guidance

4. **Contract Address Always Provided**
   - Even if confirmation times out
   - Includes tonviewer link for manual verification
   - Transaction may still succeed

### 🚀 How to Use Now

#### Quick Fix - Run Diagnostic First:
```bash
cd foundrising_old
npx blueprint run walletDiagnostic --testnet
```

#### Deploy with Improved Script:
```bash
npx blueprint run deployCrowdfundingMaster --testnet --tonconnect [jettonMaster] [price]
```

#### Alternative Connection Methods:
```bash
# If TON Connect doesn't work
npx blueprint run deployCrowdfundingMaster --testnet --deeplink [jettonMaster] [price]

# Or use mnemonic
npx blueprint run deployCrowdfundingMaster --testnet --mnemonic [jettonMaster] [price]
```

### 📱 What to Expect

1. **Clear Instructions**: Script tells you exactly what to do
2. **Wallet Prompts**: "Please check your wallet and CONFIRM the transaction"
3. **Timeout Warnings**: If timeout occurs, script provides next steps
4. **Success Verification**: Contract address + tonviewer link always provided

### 🛠️ If Problems Still Occur

#### Step 1: Check Wallet
- ✅ Wallet app is open and responsive
- ✅ Balance > 0.1 TON for fees
- ✅ No pending transactions blocking new ones

#### Step 2: Test Connection
```bash
npx blueprint run walletDiagnostic --testnet
```

#### Step 3: Try Different Method
- Switch between `--tonconnect`, `--deeplink`, `--mnemonic`
- Restart wallet app completely
- Check internet connection

#### Step 4: Manual Verification
- Use provided tonviewer link
- Check if contract deployed successfully
- Contract address is always shown

### 🎯 Key Improvements

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| ❌ Script hangs indefinitely | ✅ 60s timeout with helpful messages |
| ❌ No feedback on what's happening | ✅ Clear step-by-step instructions |

### 📋 Complete Workflow

1. **Prepare**: Run diagnostic to verify wallet connection
2. **Deploy**: Use improved script with timeouts
3. **Monitor**: Watch for wallet approval prompts
4. **Verify**: Check tonviewer link for deployment status
5. **Continue**: Proceed with SetJettonWallet if deployment succeeded
